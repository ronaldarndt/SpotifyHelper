# SpotifyHelper

App i created for my personal use.

This solves an issue i have all the time. Backstory:
I like to play games while listening to music on spotify. Sometimes i feel like discovering new music so i play random playlists. Very often i like a song and want to listen to it later but don't wanna alt+tab.

So with this app i can press alt+f1 or whatever i configured, and save the current playing song to my playlist.
